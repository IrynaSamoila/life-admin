Most document retention advice is vague. "Keep important documents" isn't helpful. Here's exactly what to keep and for how long.

## The Three-Category System

Every document falls into one of three categories:

**Keep Forever (Physical):** Original documents you cannot replace
**Keep Temporarily (Digital):** Scan and keep digital copy for specific period
**Destroy Immediately:** No value after verification

## Keep Forever (Physical Originals)

These cannot be replaced or require original signatures for legal purposes.

### Identity Documents

**Keep original, never destroy:**
- Birth certificate
- Marriage certificate
- Divorce decree
- Death certificates (family members)
- Adoption papers
- Passport (current)
- Citizenship/naturalization papers

**Why:** Required for legal processes, cannot be replaced easily, often need original certified copies.

**Storage:** Fireproof safe or safety deposit box.

### Property Documents

**Keep original, never destroy:**
- Property deeds
- Title documents
- Mortgage discharge documents
- Property survey documents
- Planning permission documents
- Building regulation certificates

**Why:** Prove ownership, required for sale, needed for remortgage.

**Storage:** Fireproof safe. Copies to solicitor.

### Legal Documents

**Keep original, never destroy:**
- Wills (your copy)
- Power of attorney documents
- Trust documents
- Court orders
- Settlement agreements
- Custody agreements

**Why:** Legal validity requires originals in many cases.

**Storage:** Fireproof safe. Tell executor/family where they are.

### Vehicle Documents

**Keep original while you own vehicle:**
- Vehicle registration (V5C)
- Purchase receipts for major modifications

**Keep for 6 years after sale:**
- Sale confirmation
- Purchase receipt

**Why:** Prove ownership, required for sale, needed for disputes.

## Keep Temporarily (Scan Then Destroy)

These have value for specific periods. Scan immediately, destroy physical after retention period.

### Tax Documents - Keep 6 Years

**After tax year ends, keep for 6 years:**
- Tax returns and supporting documents
- P60s
- P45s
- Self-assessment records
- Business expense receipts

**Why:** HMRC can investigate up to 6 years back (20 years for fraud, but you know if you committed fraud).

Usually: Keep one previous passport, destroy older ones.

## The Practical Retention System

Theory is useless without a system to implement it.

### Physical Documents You Keep

**Get a fireproof safe or box:**
- Birth certificates
- Marriage certificates
- Property deeds
- Wills
- Passport (current)

That's it. Everything else gets scanned and destroyed.

### Scanning System

**When document arrives:**
1. Open/read it
2. Determine category (forever/temporary/destroy)
3. If temporary: Scan immediately
4. File in appropriate folder with retention date
5. Shred physical

**Folder structure:**
```
Documents/
├── Permanent/
│   ├── Identity/
│   ├── Property/
│   └── Medical-Major/
├── Tax-2024/ (delete after 2030)
├── Tax-2023/ (delete after 2029)
├── Medical-2024/ (delete after 2027)
└── Employment-CurrentJob/ (delete 1 year after leaving)
```

### Calendar Reminders

Set annual reminder: "Delete old documents"

**On this day each year:**
1. Delete tax folders older than 6 years
2. Delete medical folders older than 3 years
3. Delete employment folders for jobs left 1+ year ago
4. Delete bank statements older than 1 year

Takes 10 minutes once per year.

## What About Legal Requirements?

These retention periods are based on UK law and common legal requirements.

**Tax:** HMRC requires 6 years (5 years + current year)
**Employment:** 6 years for potential claims
**Medical:** 3 years typical, longer for ongoing conditions
**Financial:** 6 years for disputes

**Different countries have different rules.** Check your jurisdiction's requirements.

## Shredding vs. Regular Bin

Documents containing personal information must be shredded.

**Always shred:**
- Bank statements
- Credit card statements
- Anything with account numbers
- Anything with your address and name
- Medical records
- Tax documents
- Payslips

**Can throw away normally:**
- Generic receipts
- Appointment reminders (no personal info)
- Marketing materials
- Expired vouchers

Get a cross-cut shredder. £30 investment prevents identity theft.

## Common Questions

### "What if I need it later?"

You won't. Follow the retention periods. If you genuinely need something after disposal, you can usually request copies:
- Bank statements: Request from bank
- Medical records: Request from GP
- Tax records: HMRC holds your records

### "But it feels wasteful to throw away documents"

Keeping everything is more wasteful. You waste:
- Space storing them
- Time searching through them
- Mental energy remembering they exist

Destruction is often the efficient choice.

### "What about sentimental documents?"

Sentimental value is separate from administrative retention.

Keep sentimental items in a separate box labeled "Memories." Don't mix with administrative documents.

## The One-Time Purge

If you have years of accumulated documents:

**Weekend project (4-6 hours):**

**Saturday:**
1. Gather all documents in one place
2. Sort into piles: Forever / Temporary / Destroy
3. Scan "Temporary" pile with retention dates
4. File "Forever" pile in safe

**Sunday:**
1. Shred everything in "Destroy" pile
2. Shred physical copies of scanned documents
3. Organise digital files with clear retention dates
4. Set annual calendar reminder to purge old files

**Result:** Clear understanding of what you have and why you're keeping it.

## Maintenance (15 Minutes Monthly)

**First Sunday of each month:**
1. Gather documents from last month
2. Scan what needs keeping
3. Shred what can be destroyed
4. File scans with retention dates

Don't let documents pile up. Process monthly prevents backlog.

The system is simple: Most documents are temporary. Scan them, set a deletion date, destroy the physical copy.

Very few documents need to be kept forever. Those go in a fireproof safe.

Everything else gets shredded.

Boring. Clear. Done.
