Meal planning doesn't have to be complicated. You don't need fancy apps, Pinterest boards, or colour-coded spreadsheets. You need a system that removes daily decisions and runs on autopilot.

## The Core Problem

Decision fatigue is real. After a full day of work, the question "what's for dinner?" triggers a decision cascade:

- What ingredients do we have?
- What haven't we eaten recently?
- Does everyone like this?
- Is there time to cook it?
- Do we need to shop first?

This is exhausting. The solution isn't better decisions. It's fewer decisions.

## The Simple Rotation Framework

Instead of planning specific meals, plan categories. Here's a basic seven-day rotation:

- **Monday**: Pasta night
- **Tuesday**: Taco/bowl night
- **Wednesday**: Soup/stew night
- **Thursday**: Stir-fry night
- **Friday**: Pizza night
- **Saturday**: Grill/protein + vegetables
- **Sunday**: Leftovers/clean out fridge

Categories, not specific recipes. This gives structure while maintaining flexibility.

## Why This Works

### Predictable Shopping

Each category has core ingredients that rarely change:

**Pasta night essentials:**
- Pasta (3 different shapes always in pantry)
- Canned tomatoes
- Garlic, onions
- Olive oil
- Parmesan

**Taco night essentials:**
- Tortillas (frozen)
- Beans
- Rice
- Salsa
- Cheese
- Basic spices

You always know what to buy because the categories don't change. Most ingredients are pantry-stable.

### Built-in Variety

Within each category, rotate through variations:

**Pasta night rotations:**
- Simple marinara with vegetables
- Pesto with white beans
- Aglio e olio with broccoli
- Cacio e pepe

Same category, different execution, using the same core ingredients.

### Minimal Prep Time

Because you know Monday is pasta night, you can:
- Defrost sauce on Sunday if needed
- Boil water before changing clothes
- Prep vegetables while water heats

The routine creates efficiency without thinking.

## The Shopping List Template

Create a static shopping list template based on your rotation. Mine looks like this:

<SimpleList title="WEEKLY STAPLES (Buy Every Week)">
- Fresh vegetables (seasonal)
- Fresh fruit (seasonal)
- Eggs
- Milk
- Bread
</SimpleList>

<SimpleList title="CATEGORY SUPPLIES (Restock as needed)">
Pasta Night:
- Pasta
- Canned tomatoes
- Parmesan

Taco Night:
- Tortillas
- Beans
- Rice

[etc.]
</SimpleList>

Check your pantry once weekly. Restock what's low. That's the entire shopping planning process.

## The Three-Recipe Rule

For each category, maintain exactly three recipes you can make without looking anything up.

Why three?
- One is boring
- Two feels repetitive
- Three provides variety without decision overhead
- Four or more creates choice paralysis

Examples for **stir-fry night**:
1. Basic vegetable stir-fry with soy-ginger sauce
2. Cashew "chicken" (or actual chicken)
3. Thai basil stir-fry

These should be so memorized you could make them while half-asleep.

## Handling Dietary Restrictions

The rotation system adapts easily to restrictions:

**Vegetarian**: Most categories work with beans/tofu substitutions
**Gluten-free**: Swap pasta for rice noodles, use corn tortillas
**Dairy-free**: Skip cheese, use nutritional yeast or omit

The categories stay the same. The specific ingredients adjust.

## The Setup Process

### Step 1: Define Your Categories (30 minutes)

Pick seven category nights based on:
- What you already cook
- What shares ingredients
- What's realistic for your schedule

Don't copy mine. Use categories that match your actual eating patterns.

### Step 2: Choose Three Recipes Per Category (1 hour)

For each category:
1. Write down one recipe you already make regularly
2. Find two similar recipes using the same core ingredients
3. Simplify each recipe to essential steps only

Test these recipes over the next two weeks. Adjust as needed.

### Step 3: Build Core Shopping List (30 minutes)

List all ingredients needed across your categories. Separate into:
- Pantry staples (buy monthly)
- Weekly fresh items (buy weekly)
- Restock items (buy as needed)

This becomes your permanent shopping template.

### Step 4: Create Quick Reference (15 minutes)

Make a simple reference sheet:
- Monday: Pasta (marinara / pesto / aglio)
- Tuesday: Tacos (beans / carnitas / veggie)
- [etc.]

Put this on your fridge. No apps, no phones, just visible reference.

## The Weekly Routine

### Sunday Evening (15 minutes):
- Check rotation schedule for coming week
- Review pantry/fridge
- Make shopping list from template
- Order groceries or plan store trip

### Daily (5 minutes):
- Look at what tonight's category is
- Check if you need to defrost anything
- Pick one of your three variations based on what sounds good

That's it. Total planning time: 20 minutes weekly.

## Handling Variations and Exceptions

### Eating Out

Just skip that night's category. The rotation continues next day. No need to "make up" missed meals.

### Guests

Most categories scale easily:
- Double pasta recipe
- More tacos
- Bigger stir-fry

Or declare it pizza night regardless of schedule. The rotation is a guide, not a law.

### Schedule Changes

If Wednesday's schedule is chaos, make Wednesday your "leftovers night" instead of Sunday. Adapt the rotation to your reality.

### Cooking Fatigue

Schedule at least one "easy night" in your rotation:
- Leftovers night
- Grilled cheese and soup
- Breakfast for dinner

Some nights you don't want to cook. Plan for this.

## Signs Your System Needs Adjustment

After one month, evaluate:

- **Shopping list consistently missing items**: Refine your template
- **Same variation every week**: Your three recipes aren't varied enough
- **Skipping certain categories frequently**: Replace that category with something you'll actually cook
- **Taking too long to prep**: Recipes are too complex, simplify

The system should get easier over time, not harder.

## What Success Looks Like

After implementing this system:

- Grocery shopping takes 15 minutes of planning (down from 45+)
- The question "what's for dinner?" has a default answer
- You stop throwing away ingredients that didn't get used
- Cooking feels routine instead of stressful
- You actually eat at home more consistently

## Common Objections

**"This seems boring"**: Routine isn't boring when it eliminates stress. Plus, you have variety within categories.

**"I like cooking new recipes"**: Great! Do that on weekends. This system handles Monday-Friday.

**"My family won't eat the same categories weekly"**: Ask them. Most people prefer predictability over surprise when it comes to basic meals.

## Getting Started

Don't overthink this.

1. Pick seven category nights
2. Choose one recipe per category you already know
3. Shop for those ingredients
4. Run it for one week

Refine based on what actually happens. The perfect system is the one you'll use next month, not the one that looks best on paper.

Start simple. Adjust as needed. Keep it boring.
