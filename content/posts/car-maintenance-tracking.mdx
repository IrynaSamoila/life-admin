Car maintenance has deadlines. MOTs, services, insurance, tax. Some are legal requirements. All cost more if you forget them.

Here's how to track everything without spreadsheet overload.

## What Actually Needs Tracking

Not every car-related task. Just the scheduled and required ones.

**Legal requirements:**
- MOT (annual test)
- Car tax (annual or 6-monthly)
- Car insurance (annual)

**Recommended maintenance:**
- Annual service
- Oil changes (if not covered by service)
- Tyre rotation/replacement
- Brake checks
- Battery checks

**Mileage-based:**
- Major service intervals
- Cambelt replacement
- Brake fluid change

## The Two-Part System

Part 1: Calendar for date-based tasks
Part 2: Mileage tracker for mileage-based tasks

Both necessary. Different triggers.

## Part 1: Date-Based Tracking

Calendar events with smart reminders.

### MOT Test

**Set three calendar events:**

**Event 1: 60 days before expiry**
- Title: "PREPARE: MOT due in 2 months"
- Action: Research garages, get quotes
- Time to shop around

**Event 2: 30 days before expiry**
- Title: "BOOK: MOT appointment"
- Action: Book test at chosen garage
- Still legal to drive

**Event 3: 7 days before expiry**
- Title: "MOT test booked for [date]"
- Action: Verify appointment, prepare car
- Final reminder

**Event 4: Expiry date**
- Title: "DEADLINE: MOT expires today"
- If you see this, something went wrong
- Don't drive after this date without MOT

**After test:**

### Annual Service

**Set two calendar events:**

**Event 1: 30 days before due**
- Title: "BOOK: Annual service due"
- Action: Book service appointment
- Based on last service date or mileage

**Event 2: Service due date**
- Title: "Service due"
- Reminder if you haven't booked

**After service:**
- Update calendar for next year
- Save service receipt
- Note any recommendations
- Update mileage tracker

## Part 2: Mileage-Based Tracking

Simple spreadsheet with one row per service type.

### Spreadsheet Structure

```
| Service Type | Last Done Mileage | Next Due Mileage | Interval | Last Done Date | Notes |
```

**Example entries:**
```
| Oil Change        | 45,000 | 50,000 | 5,000  | 15/06/2023 | Fully synthetic |
| Major Service     | 40,000 | 60,000 | 20,000 | 01/03/2023 | Next one includes cambelt check |
| Tyre Rotation     | 48,000 | 54,000 | 6,000  | 10/08/2023 | Check tread depth |
| Brake Check       | 42,000 | 52,000 | 10,000 | 15/05/2023 | Pads at 40% |
```

### Using the Mileage Tracker

**Check monthly:**
- Note current mileage
- Compare against "Next Due" column
- If within 1,000 miles of service: Book it

**After each service:**
- Update "Last Done Mileage"
- Calculate next due (Last + Interval)
- Update "Last Done Date"
- Add notes about service

### Common Service Intervals

**Note:** Service intervals vary by manufacturer and driving conditions. Always check your vehicle's manual for specific guidance. The following are typical ranges:

**Typically every 5,000-10,000 miles:**
- Oil change (varies by oil type)
- Basic health check

**Typically every 10,000-12,000 miles:**
- Minor service (oil, filters, checks)

**Typically every 20,000-24,000 miles:**
- Major service (includes minor service plus more)

**Typically every 60,000-100,000 miles:**
- Cambelt/timing chain check/replacement
- Transmission fluid
- Coolant flush
- Major component inspections

Check your car's manual for specific intervals.

## The Service Record Book

Keep physical or digital record of all work done.

### What to Record

**For every service/repair:**
- Date
- Mileage
- Work performed
- Parts replaced
- Cost
- Garage name
- Any recommendations

### Why Keep Records

**Resale value:**
- Full service history increases value
- Proves car is maintained
- Buyers want to see this

**Warranty claims:**
- May require proof of maintenance
- Service history shows regular care

**Pattern spotting:**
- Recurring issues identified
- Helps diagnose problems

**Budgeting:**
- See what you actually spend
- Plan for upcoming costs

### Storage Options

**Physical book:**
- Many cars come with service book
- Garage stamps it
- Keep in car (or safe at home)

**Digital folder:**
- Scan all receipts
- Name: YYYY-MM-DD_Service_Mileage
- Example: 2024-03-08_AnnualService_45000
- Cloud backup

**Both:**
- Physical as primary (for resale)
- Digital as backup (in case book lost)

## Tyre Management

Separate from general maintenance because tires need specific tracking.

### What to Track

**Tyre information:**
- Size (from sidewall)
- Brand/model currently fitted
- Purchase date
- Mileage when fitted

**Condition tracking:**
- Tread depth (check monthly)
- Pressure (check monthly)
- Visible damage
- Rotation schedule (every 6,000-8,000 miles)

### Tread Depth Monitoring

**Legal minimum:** 1.6mm across central 3/4 of tyre

**Replace when:** 3mm (for safety margin)

**Check with:**
- 20p coin (outer band should be visible if tread is deep enough)
- Tread depth gauge (£5, more accurate)

**Monthly check:**
- Insert 20p into tread
- If outer band visible: Tread is good
- If not visible: Tread is low, measure properly

**Record in tracker:**
- Date checked
- Depth measurement (if using gauge)
- Tires checked (note if any lower than others)

### Tyre Pressure

**Check monthly:**
- Recommended pressure on sticker (driver's door frame)
- Check when cold (not after driving)
- Include spare tyre

**Note in tracker:**
- Date checked
- Any pressure adjustments made
- If repeatedly losing pressure: Note for garage

## Warning Light Response System

When dashboard lights appear, you need system to track and respond.

### When Warning Light Appears

**Immediate actions:**
1. Note what light appeared
2. Check manual for meaning
3. Assess severity:
   - Red = Stop immediately
   - Amber = Get checked soon
   - Yellow = Monitor and book service

4. Add to car maintenance tracker
5. Book garage if needed

### Tracking Intermittent Issues

**For lights that come and go:**
- Note date/time each occurrence
- Note conditions (weather, speed, etc.)
- Pattern helps diagnosis
- Show garage your notes

## The Monthly Car Check Routine

10 minutes monthly prevents forgotten maintenance.

**First Sunday of each month:**

**Check dashboard reminders:**
- Mileage to next service
- Any warning lights

**Physical checks (5 minutes):**
- Tyre pressure (all including spare)
- Tread depth (20p test)
- Windscreen washer fluid
- Obvious leaks under car

**Update trackers (5 minutes):**
- Record mileage
- Check if anything due soon
- Book appointments if needed

**Review calendar:**
- Any MOT/insurance/tax coming up
- Appointments booked

Done. Back to life.

## Preparing for MOT

Month before test, do pre-MOT check to avoid failures.

### Common MOT Failures (Check These)

**Lights:**
- All lights work (headlights, brake, indicators, reverse)
- No blown bulbs
- Replace before test

**Tires:**
- Tread depth above 1.6mm
- No visible damage
- Correct pressure

**Brakes:**
- No squealing or grinding
- Brake fluid at correct level
- Handbrake works

**Windscreen:**
- No chips/cracks in driver's view (larger than 10mm)
- Wipers work and don't streak

**Horn:**
- Works

**Seat belts:**
- All present and working
- No fraying

Fix obvious issues before test. Saves re-test fee.

## Dealing with Unexpected Repairs

Not all maintenance is planned.

### When Something Breaks

**Immediate:**
1. Assess if car is safe to drive
2. If not safe: Don't drive, call recovery
3. If safe: Book garage appointment

**Before garage:**
- Note symptoms clearly
- When did it start
- Does it happen always or sometimes
- Recent changes or work

**At garage:**
- Describe symptoms clearly
- Ask for written quote before work
- Ask about warranty on repair
- Get itemized receipt

**After repair:**
- Add to service record
- Update mileage tracker if relevant
- Note garage quality (use again or avoid)

### Emergency Fund

Cars break. Budget for it.

**Typical annual costs:**
- MOT: £35-55
- Service: £100-400
- Insurance: £400-1,500
- Tax: £20-700
- Tires (every 2-3 years): £200-600
- Unexpected repairs: £200-500

**Total:** £1,000-3,500/year depending on car age and type.

Set aside monthly. Prevents panic when bill arrives.

## Digital vs. Physical Tracking

**Recommendation:** Both.

**Calendar (digital):**
- Date-based reminders
- Automatic recurring events
- Alerts on phone

**Service book (physical):**
- Proves maintenance for resale
- Standard format garages understand
- Stays with car

**Mileage tracker (digital):**
- Easy to update
- Quick to reference
- Backed up automatically

**Receipts (both):**
- Physical in service book
- Digital scans as backup

## When to DIY vs. Garage

Some maintenance you can do. Some needs professionals.

### Safe to DIY:

**If competent:**
- Washer fluid top-up
- Basic bulb replacement
- Air filter replacement
- Battery terminal cleaning
- Tyre pressure checking

**Learn once, do forever.**

### Always Use Garage:

**For safety and legality:**
- MOT (must be authorised centre)
- Anything brake-related
- Anything safety-critical
- Anything needing specialist tools
- Anything affecting warranty

Don't save £30 on repairs and create £3,000 problem.

## The New Car Setup

When you get different car, set up tracking from day one.

**Day 1:**
1. Find service book (or create digital one)
2. Note current mileage
3. Find MOT expiry date (check online at gov.uk/check-mot-history)
4. Find insurance expiry
5. Find tax expiry

**Week 1:**
6. Set up all calendar reminders
7. Create mileage tracker with service intervals
8. Read manual for service schedule
9. Take photos of tyre size/specs

**Month 1:**
10. First monthly check routine
11. Learn where everything is (fluid caps, spare tyre, etc.)
12. Find good local garage

Start organised, stay organised.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Relying on Memory

You won't remember MOT is due in 3 months. Calendar will.

### Waiting Until Due Date

Everything is more expensive and stressful last-minute.

### Not Keeping Records

Reduces resale value. Harder to track patterns. Wastes money.

### Ignoring Warning Lights

Small problems become expensive problems. Check immediately.

### Skipping Monthly Checks

5-10 minutes monthly prevents expensive failures.
