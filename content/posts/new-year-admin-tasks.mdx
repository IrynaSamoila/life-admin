> **Note:** This guide covers UK-based admin tasks. Tax allowances and legal requirements change over time - always verify current rules.

New Year isn't about resolutions. It's about setting up systems that prevent admin problems for the next twelve months.

Skip the vision boards. Do these tasks in the first week of January instead.

This guide focuses on practical admin tasks that prevent missed deadlines, fees, and unnecessary stress throughout the year.

## Financial Admin (45 minutes)

**Update your budget baseline**
- Check current account balances
- Review last 3 months of spending
- Adjust budget categories based on reality, not aspiration
- Set up spending alerts if your bank offers them

**Annual subscription audit**
- List everything that renewed in December/January
- Cancel anything you didn't use in the last quarter
- Check for price increases on subscriptions you're keeping
- Set calendar reminders for next year's renewal dates

**Tax preparation start**
- Create folder for this tax year's documents (UK tax year runs 6 April to 5 April)
- Set monthly reminder to add receipts/documents
- Note any life changes that affect taxes (moved house, changed jobs, started freelancing)
- Be aware that tax thresholds and allowances can change each tax year
- Don't wait until the deadline

## Calendar Setup (30 minutes)

- Tax year end (5 April) for ISA and pension planning
- MOT due date
- Insurance renewals (car, home, health)
- Boiler service
- Pet vaccinations/treatments

- Add half-term weeks too

## Document Organisation (20 minutes)

**Archive last year's documents**
- Move previous year's receipts/statements to archive folder
- Create fresh folders for the new year (one for each category you use)
- Shred anything older than your retention period requires
- Update your filing system if it didn't work well last year

**Check expiry dates**
- Passport (renew early if it expires soon, especially if you plan to travel)
- Driver's licence
- Identity documents
- Professional certifications

## Household Systems (15 minutes)

**Update emergency contact lists**
- Print new copy with current phone numbers

- Remove outdated contacts from last year

**Review home inventory**

**Check smoke alarm and CO detector batteries**

- Add reminder for same time next year

## Digital Housekeeping (25 minutes)

- Use this as opportunity to enable two-factor auth if you haven't

**Backup everything important**

- Test that you can actually restore from backup

## Medical Admin (10 minutes)

**Schedule annual checks**

- Book them now before you forget

**Update medication list**
- What you're currently taking
- Dosages
- Prescribing doctor
- Keep copy in wallet and phone
- Essential in emergencies

**Check medical aid/insurance benefits**
- What you're entitled to this year
- Whether you need to re-register
- If you're using your benefits or wasting money

## The One Thing You Must Do

If you only do one task: **Create a simple calendar with all your annual renewal dates**.

Everything else can wait. But knowing when things are due prevents the scrambling, late fees, and expired services that cause stress all year.

**Critical dates to add:**
- Tax year end (5 April) for ISA and pension contributions (verify current allowances)
- Insurance renewal dates
- MOT due date
- Annual subscriptions

Set the reminders now. Your future self will thank you.

## What Not to Do

Don't create elaborate systems you won't maintain. Don't set ambitious goals without specific actions. Don't reorganize your entire life.

Just do these basic admin tasks. They prevent problems. That's more valuable than any resolution.

## Time Investment

Total time for all tasks: About 2.5 hours.

Spread across first week of January, that's 20 minutes a day. Manageable even with work and family obligations.

Or do it all in one morning. Put on podcast, work through the list, be done by lunch.

## When to Do This

First week of January, before normal routine resumes. Not on January 1st (you're recovering from New Year).

January 2-7 is ideal. Early enough to count as "start of year," late enough that you're functional.

Don't wait until end of January. By then you've already missed renewal deadlines and the moment has passed.

## Tracking Completion

Make a simple checklist. Cross off each section as you complete it.

Don't overcomplicate. The goal is completion, not perfect organisation.

If you finish these tasks in the first week of January, you're ahead of 95% of people. The rest of the year runs more smoothly because you invested 2.5 hours now.

That's the entire point of new year admin. Prevention, not resolution.
