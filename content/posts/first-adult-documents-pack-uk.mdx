There's a set of documents you need as an adult in the UK. Not for daily life, but for the moments when everything depends on proving who you are.

Opening a bank account. Renting a flat. Getting a job. Starting a phone contract. You can't do any of it without the right papers.

**TL;DR:**
You need photo ID, a National Insurance number, proof of address, and one safe place to keep everything.

Here's what you actually need and how to get it.

## The Core Documents You Must Have

These four documents unlock everything else.

### 1. Proof of Identity with Photo

**Options (you need at least one):**
- UK Passport (biometric)
- UK Driving Licence (photocard)
- Biometric Residence Permit (if not UK citizen)

**Why you need it:**
Every official process requires photo ID. Bank accounts, job applications, renting property, age verification, travel. Most adult admin becomes impossible without one of these.

**If you don't have one:**

Most people get a provisional driving licence first because it's cheapest and fastest.

Apply online at gov.uk/apply-first-provisional-driving-licence. Costs £34. Usually takes 1–3 weeks. You don't need to learn to drive - the licence works as ID regardless.

Passport is £88.50 for a standard adult passport. Usually takes up to 10 weeks, sometimes longer during peak periods. Worth getting if you plan to travel, but not essential for domestic life.

**Reality check:** Get a provisional licence now even if you're not sure you'll drive. You'll need photo ID multiple times this year.

### 2. National Insurance Number

**What it is:**
A unique reference number for your tax and social security records. Format: two letters, six digits, one letter (e.g., AB 12 34 56 C).

**Why you need it:**
Required for any legal employment in the UK. Your employer needs it to report your earnings to HMRC. You also need it for claiming benefits, student loans, and state pension tracking.

**If you don't have it:**

Born in the UK: You should have been sent your number automatically just before your 16th birthday. Check old letters from your parents' house or call the National Insurance helpline: 0300 200 3500.

Moved to the UK: Apply through gov.uk/apply-national-insurance-number. You'll need proof of identity and right to work. Can take up to 16 weeks.

Lost your number: Call the helpline above or check old payslips, P60 forms, or your Personal Tax Account on gov.uk.

### 3. Birth Certificate

**Why you need it:**
Required for passport applications, some job background checks, marriage/civil partnership registration, and proving your identity when you don't have other documents yet.

**If you don't have it:**

Order a copy from gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate. Costs £11 plus postage. Takes about 4 working days.

You need to know: your full name at birth, date of birth, place of birth (town/city and country), parents' names.

Born outside UK: You'll need a birth certificate from your country of birth. Process varies by country. UK-born certificates won't exist in the UK system.

**Which version to get:**
Get the "full" certificate (shows parents' details), not the short version. Some processes specifically require the full version.

### 4. Proof of Address

**Why you need it:**
Required alongside photo ID for opening bank accounts, applying for credit, registering with a GP, electoral roll registration, and countless other services.

**What counts:**

Acceptable documents (usually dated within last 3 months):
- Bank statement
- Utility bill (gas, electric, water, council tax)
- Official letter from HMRC or DWP
- Tenancy agreement (sometimes accepted on its own)
- Mortgage statement
- UK driving licence (accepted by many organisations, but not all)

**What doesn't count:**
- Mobile phone bills
- Gym membership letters
- Amazon deliveries
- Letters from friends

**If you don't have proof:**

This is the hardest one when you first move out. It's a circular problem - you need proof of address to open a bank account, but you need a bank account to get proof of address.

**Breaking the cycle:**

1. Get on the electoral roll immediately at gov.uk/register-to-vote. Takes 5 minutes. This establishes your address in government records (helps with credit checks, though doesn't always produce a standalone proof document).

2. Ask your landlord for a signed letter confirming you live there, with their contact details. Some companies accept this.

3. Get added to a utility bill if you live with others. Contact the utility company and ask to add your name to the account as a joint account holder.

4. Open a basic bank account first (like Monzo or Starling). These often have easier proof requirements. Use their statements as proof of address for traditional banks. (Revolut is sometimes accepted but less reliable for this purpose.)

5. Register with a GP at your new address. The confirmation letter can sometimes be used as proof.

## The Supporting Documents Pack

You don't need these immediately, but you'll need them eventually.

### 5. P45 (When You Leave a Job)

**What it is:**
Official form showing your earnings and tax paid when you leave employment.

**Why you need it:**
Give it to your next employer so they tax you correctly from day one. Without it, you might be put on emergency tax (which takes more tax than necessary).

**If you don't have it:**
Your previous employer should issue your P45 on or shortly after your last working day. If they don't, chase them. If you can't get it, tell your new employer - they'll use a Starter Checklist instead (but it's slower).

### 6. P60 (End of Tax Year)

**What it is:**
Annual summary of your earnings and tax paid from April to April.

**Why you need it:**
Needed for tax rebate claims, mortgage applications, visa applications, and proof of income for various services.

**How to get it:**
Your employer must give you one by 31st May each year if you're still employed on 5th April. Keep every P60 you ever get. If you lose one, ask your employer for a copy or check your Personal Tax Account on gov.uk.

### 7. Educational Certificates

**What to keep:**
- GCSEs
- A-Levels
- Degrees
- Professional qualifications
- Trade certifications

**Why you need them:**
Job applications sometimes require proof of qualifications. Some employers want to see certificates, not just your word.

**If you've lost them:**
Contact the exam board or university. They can provide replacement certificates or certified statements of results. Often costs £20–50 per certificate.

### 8. Medical Summary (Optional But Useful)

**What to record:**
- Blood type
- Allergies
- Current medications
- Chronic conditions
- Emergency contact

**Why you need it:**
Useful if you're unconscious, traveling, or seeing a new doctor. Not mandatory, but helpful.

**How to get it:**
Request your medical summary from your GP. It's free. Keep a copy with your important documents and one on your phone.

## Documents for Specific Situations

### If You Drive

**Must have:**
- Full UK driving licence (or provisional if learning)
- Car insurance certificate
- Vehicle registration (V5C logbook)
- MOT certificate (if car is 3+ years old)

**Important:** You don't need to carry insurance or MOT certificates in your car. Police check these digitally via the Motor Insurance Database and MOT history. However, keep digital access available (photos on your phone or saved PDFs).

**Store at home:**
- V5C logbook (never keep in car - if car is stolen, they have all docs)
- Paper copies of insurance and MOT for your records

### If You Rent

**Must have:**
- Tenancy agreement (signed copy)
- Deposit protection certificate
- Landlord's contact details
- Inventory report
- Gas safety certificate
- Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)

**Keep these for 6 years after leaving:**
You might need them to prove residence history for mortgage applications, visa applications, or disputes.

### If You're Self-Employed

**Must have:**
- UTR number (Unique Taxpayer Reference)
- VAT registration number (if turnover over £90,000)
- Records of all income and expenses
- Receipts for business expenses

**Register immediately:**
Tell HMRC you're self-employed within 3 months of starting. Get your UTR sorted. Don't wait.

### If You're Not a UK Citizen

**Must have:**
- Passport from your country
- Biometric Residence Permit or visa
- Share code (proves right to work/rent in UK)

**Check your status:**
Use gov.uk/view-prove-immigration-status to get your share code. Employers and landlords need this to verify your legal status.

## Where to Store Everything

Don't keep important documents in random drawers.

**Physical storage:**
- Get a fireproof safe or lockbox (£30-100)
- Keep originals in the safe
- Put safe somewhere you'll remember
- Tell one trusted person where it is

**What goes in the safe:**
- Passport
- Birth certificate
- Driving licence (if not carried daily)
- National Insurance number record
- Educational certificates
- Tenancy agreements
- Vehicle V5C logbook

**Digital backups:**

Scan everything in your safe. Every document. Save as PDFs.

Store in secure or encrypted cloud storage:
- Cloud storage with strong password (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox)
- Password manager (many have secure document storage)
- Encrypted storage services

If your house burns down, you need to be able to rebuild your life from those scans.

**On your phone:**

Take photos of:
- Photo ID (front and back)
- National Insurance number
- Emergency contacts
- Medical information

Store in a secured notes app or password manager.

## The Quick-Start Checklist

If you're just starting out as an independent adult, do these in order:

**Week 1: Essential ID**
- Get provisional driving licence or passport (choose one for now)
- Find or order your birth certificate
- Locate your National Insurance number

**Week 2: Address Establishment**
- Register to vote at your address
- Register with a GP
- Get your name on a utility bill if possible

**Week 3: Banking**
- Open a bank account (use provisional licence + electoral roll registration)
- Set up online banking
- Download bank app for easy statement access

**Week 4: Protection**
- Buy a small fireproof safe or lockbox
- Gather all important documents into it
- Scan everything and save encrypted copies
- Create a digital note listing where everything is

## Documents You Don't Need (Despite What People Say)

**Paper TV Licence:**
Digital confirmation is fine. You just need the reference number if asked.

**Physical council tax bill:**
Online account access is enough. You don't need to keep paper copies unless you specifically need proof of address.

**Every payslip ever:**
Keep last 3-6 months. Keep your P60 from each year. That's enough.

**Receipts for everything:**
Only keep receipts for expensive items (for warranty claims), business expenses (if self-employed), or things you might return.

**Old tenancy agreements after you've left:**
Keep for 6 years for reference history purposes. After that, shred them.

## When You Move House

**Update these immediately:**
- Driving licence address (update as soon as possible - DVLA guidance)
- Electoral roll registration
- Bank accounts
- GP registration
- Employer records
- HMRC records
- Passport (not required, but good to keep current)
- Car insurance and breakdown cover
- Council tax (register at new address, close old account)

Search "notify organisations of change of address UK" for comprehensive lists, or use Royal Mail's redirection service reminder checklist.

**Set up mail redirection:**
Royal Mail redirection costs £50 for 3 months, £80 for 6 months, £110 for 12 months. Worth it to catch anything you missed.

## If You Lose Your Important Documents

**Passport lost/stolen:**
- Report immediately to Identity and Passport Service
- Apply for replacement at gov.uk/apply-renew-passport
- Cancel and replace if stolen

**Driving licence lost:**
- Report and order replacement at gov.uk/apply-online-to-replace-a-driving-licence
- Costs £20
- Takes about a week

**Birth certificate lost:**
- Order replacement from gov.uk/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate
- Costs £11
- Can order multiple copies if you want backups

**National Insurance number lost:**
- Call 0300 200 3500 to retrieve your number
- Check old payslips or P60s
- Check Personal Tax Account on gov.uk

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Not keeping documents together:**
One safe, one location. Not "probably in that drawer" or "I think I left it at my parents' house".

**No digital backups:**
If your house floods or burns down, your documents are gone. Scan everything.

**Ignoring expiry dates:**
Passports expire. Driving licences expire. Visas expire. Check dates yearly.

**Not updating addresses:**
You should update your driving licence as soon as possible when you move. Many people forget and only realize when they need to prove their current address.

**Throwing away documents you still need:**
Keep P60s permanently. Keep tenancy agreements for 6 years after leaving. Keep educational certificates forever.

## The Minimum System That Works

If you only do three things:

1. **Get photo ID** (provisional licence or passport)
2. **Know your National Insurance number** (write it down somewhere safe)
3. **Keep documents in one safe location** (not scattered around)

These three things will get you through most situations.

Everything else is optimization.

## Reality Check

You won't have everything sorted immediately. That's normal.

Start with photo ID and National Insurance number. Get proof of address sorted when you can. Build the rest over time.

The goal isn't to have a perfect filing system. The goal is to have the documents you need when you need them, without panic-searching through boxes at midnight because you need your birth certificate for a passport appointment tomorrow morning.

One safe. Digital backups. List of what's where.

That's the system.
