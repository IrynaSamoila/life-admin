Warranties matter when things break. Which is precisely when you can't remember if they're still covered.

Here's a simple tracking system that works.

## Why Warranty Tracking Matters

**Typical scenario:**
1. Appliance breaks 13 months after purchase
2. Scramble to find receipt
3. Can't find it
4. Pay for repair
5. Find receipt two weeks later showing 2-year warranty

The system prevents this.

## What Actually Needs Tracking

Not everything. Only items with warranties worth claiming.

**Track warranties for:**
- Appliances (£100+)
- Electronics (phones, laptops, tablets, cameras)
- Furniture (£200+)
- Tools and equipment (£50+)
- Vehicles
- Home improvements/installations
- Expensive clothing (if guaranteed)

**Don't track:**
- Consumables
- Items under £30
- Things you'll replace not repair
- Items with 30-day returns only

## The Spreadsheet System

One spreadsheet. Seven columns.

### Column Structure

| Item | Purchase Date | Warranty End | Cost | Retailer | Receipt Location | Notes |
|------|---------------|--------------|------|----------|------------------|-------|

**Item:** What you bought
- "Samsung Washing Machine WW90"
- Not just "washing machine"

**Purchase Date:** DD/MM/YYYY format
- Exact date from receipt

**Warranty End:** DD/MM/YYYY
- Purchase date + warranty period
- This is the column you'll check

**Cost:** What you paid
- Helps decide if warranty claim is worth it
- Reference for insurance claims

**Retailer:** Where you bought it
- Full name
- Some warranties must be claimed through retailer

**Receipt Location:** Where to find proof of purchase
- Digital file name
- Physical location
- Email date if confirmation

**Notes:** Anything relevant
- Extended warranty details
- Registration required (yes/no)
- Claim process notes
- Past issues with item

### Example Entries

| Item | Purchase Date | Warranty End | Cost | Retailer | Receipt Location | Notes |
|------|---------------|--------------|------|----------|------------------|-------|
| Washing Machine Samsung WW90 | 15/03/2023 | 15/03/2025 | £449 | John Lewis | 2023-03-15_Receipt_WashingMachine.pdf | 2yr warranty, registered online |
| iPhone 14 Pro | 22/09/2023 | 22/09/2024 | £1099 | Apple Store | Apple_Email_22Sep2023 | AppleCare until Sep 2025 if purchased |
| Bosch Drill GSB 18V | 10/11/2023 | 10/11/2026 | £89 | Screwfix | Physical receipt - Tools folder | 3yr warranty, no registration needed |

## Setting It Up

First time takes 30-45 minutes. Then it's maintained ongoing.

### Step 1: Gather Current Items (15 minutes)

Walk through your home. List items with potential active warranties:
- Kitchen appliances
- Laundry appliances
- Electronics
- Furniture
- Tools
- Recent purchases

Write them down. Don't worry about details yet.

### Step 2: Find Receipts and Warranty Info (20 minutes)

For each item:
- Check email for receipts
- Check email for warranty registration confirmations
- Check physical filing if you have it
- Check bank statements for purchase date if receipt lost

Can't find receipt? Estimate purchase date from:
- Bank statement
- Memory of when you bought it
- Installation date (for appliances)

Better to estimate than not track.

### Step 3: Create Spreadsheet and Enter Data (10 minutes)

Create columns as shown above.

Enter each item with all known information.

Leave fields blank if unknown (can fill in later).

## Ongoing Maintenance

### When You Buy Something New

**Same day as purchase:**
1. Save digital receipt
   - Email confirmation
   - Photo of physical receipt
   - Screenshot of order

2. Name file: YYYY-MM-DD_Receipt_ItemDescription
   - Example: 2024-05-22_Receipt_DysonVacuum

3. Add to spreadsheet
   - Item, date, warranty period, cost, retailer, receipt location

4. Register warranty if required
   - Some require online registration
   - Do it same day or you'll forget
   - Note in spreadsheet that it's registered

Total time: 3 minutes.

### Monthly Review (5 minutes)

First day of each month:

**Check spreadsheet:**
1. Filter by warranty end date
2. Look for warranties expiring in next 3 months
3. Note any items with issues that should be claimed before expiry

Set calendar reminder for this.

## The Calendar Alert System

Spreadsheet tracks. Calendar reminds.

### For Major Purchases (£200+)

Set calendar event 30 days before warranty expiry:

**Title:** "Warranty expires - [Item]"

**Description:**
- Item details
- Purchase date
- Where bought
- Any known issues to claim

**Action when alert fires:**
- Check item condition
- Test all functions
- Report any issues before warranty expires
- If all good, delete alert

### For Extended Warranties

If you purchased extended warranty:

Set two calendar events:
1. Manufacturer warranty expiry - "Extended warranty now active"
2. Extended warranty expiry - 30 days notice

Know which warranty is active when.

## Receipt Storage System

Two-part system: Physical and digital.

### Digital Receipts (Primary)

**Folder structure:**

<FileTree>
Receipts/
├── 2024/
├── 2023/
└── Warranties-Active/
</FileTree>

**Process:**
1. All new receipts go to Warranties-Active
2. When warranty expires, move to year folder
3. Delete receipts older than 6 years (after warranty expired)

**File naming:** YYYY-MM-DD_Retailer_Item
- Example: 2024-05-22_Currys_Microwave

### Physical Receipts (Backup)

**For major purchases:**
- Scan and save digitally (primary)
- Keep physical in folder labeled "Active Warranties"
- When warranty expires, shred physical (keep digital)

**For minor purchases:**
- Scan digitally
- Shred physical immediately

Most warranty claims accept digital receipts. Physical is backup only.

## Warranty Registration

Some warranties require registration.

### Check Registration Requirement

**When you buy:**
- Read warranty card
- Check manufacturer website
- Look for registration deadline

Some warranties void if not registered within 30 days.

### Registration Process

**Immediately after purchase:**
1. Visit manufacturer warranty registration page
2. Enter product details and purchase date
3. Upload or enter receipt information
4. Screenshot confirmation page
5. Note in spreadsheet: "Registered DD/MM/YYYY"

Set calendar reminder 7 days after purchase if you haven't registered.

## Making Warranty Claims

You've tracked everything. Now something breaks.

### Before Contacting Warranty Support

**Gather information:**
- Item name and model number
- Purchase date
- Retailer
- Receipt (digital or physical)
- Problem description
- When problem started

**Check warranty terms:**
- Is this issue covered?
- Is warranty still active?
- Do you claim through retailer or manufacturer?

### The Claim Process

**Standard process:**
1. Contact appropriate party (retailer or manufacturer)
2. Provide purchase proof
3. Describe problem
4. Follow their process (repair, replace, refund)
5. Get claim reference number
6. Note in spreadsheet

**Add to spreadsheet:**
- Column: "Claim History"
- Note: "Claimed [date] - [issue] - Ref: [number] - Outcome: [result]"

Useful if you need to claim again or sell item.

## Extended Warranties: Worth It?

Usually not. But sometimes yes.

### Generally Not Worth It

**For these items:**
- Most electronics (high replacement cost, low repair value)
- Small appliances (cheaper to replace than repair)
- Items with long manufacturer warranty already

Extended warranties often cost 15-30% of item price for coverage that rarely pays off.

### Might Be Worth It

**Consider for:**
- Expensive appliances (£800+)
- Items with high repair costs
- Products with known reliability issues
- Commercial/professional equipment

**Calculate:**
- Extended warranty cost vs. likely repair cost
- Manufacturer warranty length
- Item replacement cost

If extended warranty costs less than 1-2 likely repairs, might be worth it.

## Warranty Gotchas to Avoid

### "Warranty void if..."

**Common voidance clauses:**
- Used commercially (in business)
- Repaired by non-authorized service
- Damaged by misuse or accident
- Not installed by professional (for some appliances)

Read warranty terms. Don't void accidentally.

### Registration Deadlines

Some warranties require registration within 30/60/90 days.

**Check immediately:**
- When registration must be completed
- If warranty is valid without registration
- Penalty for late registration

Set calendar reminder if deadline exists.

### Proof of Purchase Requirements

**What they accept:**
- Original receipt
- Bank statement showing purchase
- Email confirmation
- Credit card statement

**What they don't accept:**
- Your word
- Approximate dates
- Memory of purchase

Always keep proof.

### Wear and Tear Exclusions

Most warranties don't cover normal wear:
- Batteries degrading
- Surface scratches
- Gradual deterioration

Only covers defects and faults.

## The Return Period vs. Warranty

Different things. Both worth tracking.

### Return Period (Usually 30-90 days)

**For:**
- Changed your mind
- Don't like it
- Doesn't fit needs

**Time limit:** Set by retailer (often 30 days)

**Condition:** Usually must be unused/like new

**Track separately:** Add "Return By" column if you frequently return items

### Warranty Period (Varies)

**For:**
- Item is faulty
- Doesn't work as advertised
- Breaks due to defect

**Time limit:** Manufacturer sets (1-5 years typical)

**Condition:** Doesn't need to be perfect, just genuinely faulty

Don't confuse these. Return period is much shorter.

## Special Case: Lifetime Warranties

Some products claim "lifetime warranty."

**Reality check:**
- "Lifetime" usually means expected product lifetime (not your lifetime)
- Often 10-15 years maximum
- Read fine print

**If genuinely lifetime:**
- Note in spreadsheet: "Lifetime warranty"
- Keep receipt permanently
- May transfer to new owner if you sell

**Examples:**
- Some tool brands (Snap-on, Craftsman)
- Some luggage brands (Briggs & Riley)
- Some cookware (Le Creuset)

Worth tracking because genuinely valuable.

## Digital Tools (If You Prefer)

Spreadsheet is recommended. But if you want apps:

### Warranty Tracking Apps

**Options:**
- Centriq (free, good for appliances)
- Sortly (free tier available)
- MyStuff2 (iOS, free)

**Pros:**
- Photos of items
- Barcode scanning
- Automatic expiry reminders

**Cons:**
- Another app to maintain
- Company might shut down
- Lock-in to their system

**Recommendation:** Spreadsheet is simpler and more reliable.

### Photo Storage

**Take photos of:**
- Item when new
- Model/serial number label
- Receipt
- Warranty card

**Store in:**
- Same cloud folder as digital receipts
- Name consistently
- Useful for insurance claims too

## The Minimal System

If full spreadsheet seems like overkill:

**Absolute minimum:**
- Calendar event for each warranty expiry
- Digital copy of receipt
- That's it

Better than tracking nothing.

But spreadsheet takes 30 minutes to set up and provides much better overview.

## When Things Break Outside Warranty

Spreadsheet is still useful.

**Check:**
- Purchase date (age of item)
- What you paid (worth repairing?)
- Past claim history (reliability issue?)

**Helps decide:**
- Repair or replace?
- Worth claiming on home insurance?
- Contact manufacturer anyway (goodwill sometimes offered)
