Medical records matter when you need them. Emergencies, new doctors, referrals, insurance claims.

Here's how to organise them so they're actually accessible.

## The Core Problem

Medical information arrives from multiple sources at random times:
- GP appointments
- Hospital visits
- Prescriptions
- Test results
- Specialist letters

No single system tracks everything. You're responsible for keeping your own records.

## The Two-Part System

### Part 1: Digital Archive (Everything)

Comprehensive record of all medical history.

**Format:** Scanned PDFs in organised folders

**Purpose:** Long-term reference, new doctor intake, medical history questions

### Part 2: Current Medical Summary (One Page)

Essential information accessible immediately.

**Format:** Single document, printed and digital

**Purpose:** Emergencies, new providers, travel, quick reference

Both parts necessary. Different use cases.

## Setting Up the Digital Archive

### Folder Structure

<FileTree>
Medical/
├── Permanent/
│   ├── Vaccinations/
│   ├── Allergies/
│   ├── Major-Diagnoses/
│   └── Surgeries/
├── Prescriptions/
│   └── Current/
│   └── Past/
├── Test-Results/
│   └── YYYY/
├── Appointments/
│   └── YYYY/
└── Insurance/
</FileTree>

Simple structure. Everything has a clear home.

### What Goes in Permanent Folder

Keep forever:
- Vaccination records
- Allergy documentation
- Major diagnosis letters
- Surgery records
- Chronic condition diagnosis
- Genetic test results

These form your baseline medical history.

### What Goes in Prescriptions Folder

**Current:** Active prescriptions only
- Current prescription details
- Dosage instructions
- Prescribing doctor
- Pharmacy information

**Past:** Discontinued medications
- Move here when you stop taking medication
- Keep for at least 3 years
- Useful for "have you tried..." questions

### What Goes in Test Results Folder

Organise by year:
- Blood tests
- X-rays/scans
- Specialist tests
- Screening results

Keep all results for at least 3 years. Keep abnormal results permanently.

### What Goes in Appointments Folder

By year:
- Appointment letters
- GP visit notes (if provided)
- Specialist consultation letters
- Follow-up instructions

Delete after 3 years unless related to ongoing condition.

## The Current Medical Summary

## Collecting Your Medical Records

You need to actively gather your records.

### From Your GP

**Request complete medical records:**
- Most practices provide summaries
- Some charge fees for full records
- Allow 30 days for processing
- Usually free for first request

**Request online:**
- Many practices have patient portals
- Download test results, prescription lists
- More immediate than paper requests

### From Hospitals

**After appointments:**
- Ask for copy of consultation letter
- Request test result copies
- Some provide automatically, some require asking

**Discharge summaries:**
- Always get a copy when discharged
- Contains critical information about hospitalization

### From Specialists

**At each appointment:**
- Ask for copy of any letters they send to GP
- Request copies of test results
- Take notes during appointment

Most specialists send letters to GP but not to you automatically.

### From Pharmacies

**Prescription history:**
- Most pharmacies provide printed history
- Shows all medications dispensed
- Useful for verifying current medications

## Scanning and Filing Process

Make this routine whenever medical documents arrive.

### Immediate Scanning (Same Day)

**When medical mail arrives:**
1. Open and read
2. Scan immediately using phone
3. Name file: YYYY-MM-DD_Type_Description
   - Example: 2024-06-18_TestResult_BloodPanel
4. Save to appropriate folder
5. Shred physical copy (unless original needed)

**Keep physical originals:**
- Official vaccination cards
- Documents requiring original signature
- Prescriptions that need physical delivery

Everything else: Scan and shred.

### Filing Rules

**Test results:**
- File by date in Test-Results/YYYY
- If related to specific condition, duplicate in Permanent folder

**Prescriptions:**
- Current prescriptions in Prescriptions/Current
- When stopped, move to Prescriptions/Past
- Keep past prescriptions for 3 years

**Appointment letters:**
- Before appointment: Keep in easy access
- After appointment: Scan and file in Appointments/YYYY
- Keep appointment notes with letters

## What to Bring to Appointments

Different appointments need different information.

### GP Appointment

**Bring:**
- Current Medical Summary
- Recent test results (if relevant)
- List of symptoms with dates
- Current medications list

**Don't bring:**
- Entire medical history
- Unrelated test results
- Every document you've ever received

### Specialist Appointment (First Visit)

**Bring:**
- Complete Medical Summary
- Referral letter from GP

- Previous specialist letters (if seeing new specialist for same issue)
- List of questions

### Emergency Department

**Bring:**
- Medical Summary (wallet copy)
- Current medications list

If unconscious, emergency responders will check wallet for medical information.

## The Medication List

Critical subset of medical information.

### What to Track

For each medication:
- Generic name (not just brand)
- Dosage (mg, ml, etc.)
- Frequency (once daily, twice daily, etc.)
- Route (oral, topical, injection)
- What it's for (blood pressure, diabetes, etc.)
- Prescribing doctor
- Start date
- Any important notes (take with food, avoid alcohol, etc.)

### Medication Tracking Methods

**Option 1: Spreadsheet**

| Medication | Dosage | Frequency | For | Doctor | Started |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----|--------|---------|
| Metformin | 500mg | 2x daily | Diabetes | Dr. Smith | Jan 2020 |

**Option 2: Note on phone**
Simple list in Notes app, kept updated

**Option 3: Printed card**
Laminated card in wallet, updated as needed

Choose what you'll actually maintain.

### Updating Medication List

**Update immediately when:**
- Starting new medication
- Stopping medication
- Changing dosage
- Switching medications

Don't wait. Update the moment it changes.

## Emergency Medical Information

In serious emergencies, you might not be able to communicate.

### ICE (In Case of Emergency)

**Phone contacts:**
- Add "ICE" before contact names
- Example: "ICE - Sarah (Wife)"
- Include relationship

Paramedics and emergency staff check for ICE contacts.

### Medical ID on Phone

**iPhone:** Health app → Medical ID
**Android:** Emergency information in Contacts

**Include:**
- Name, DOB, blood type
- Emergency contacts
- Allergies
- Critical medications
- Major medical conditions
- Organ donor status

Accessible from lock screen in emergencies.

### Physical Medical Alert

**Consider if you have:**
- Severe allergies
- Diabetes
- Heart conditions
- Epilepsy
- Any condition requiring immediate treatment knowledge

**Options:**
- Medical alert bracelet
- Medical alert necklace
- Medical ID card in wallet

Not necessary for everyone. If you have life-threatening conditions, it's worth it.

## Privacy and Security

Medical records contain sensitive information.

### Digital Security

**Protect your medical files:**
- Password-protected cloud storage
- Encrypted if storing locally
- Don't email unencrypted medical records
- Use secure sharing if sending to doctors

**Backup:**
- Cloud backup (encrypted)
- External drive backup
- Don't rely on single storage location

### Physical Security

**Medical summary:**
- Keep in wallet (acceptable risk for emergency access)
- Don't leave lying around
- Shred when updating

**Full medical archive:**
- No physical copies needed
- Digital is sufficient
- If printing for appointment, shred after

## Special Situations

### Managing for Children

**Keep separate folders:**
- Each child gets own medical folder
- Track vaccinations meticulously
- School often requires medical history

**Include:**

Transfer to child at age 18.

### Managing for Elderly Parents

## When to Purge Records

Not everything needs keeping forever.

**Delete after 3 years:**
- Routine test results (if normal)
- Appointment letters for resolved issues
- Prescription records for discontinued medications
- Routine screening (if results normal and newer screening available)

**Keep permanently:**
- Vaccinations
- Major diagnoses
- Surgery records
- Abnormal test results
- Chronic condition documentation

Annual purge: Each January, delete files older than 3 years (except permanent items).

## The Monthly Medical Admin Routine

First Sunday of each month, 10 minutes:

**Review and update:**
1. File any new medical documents received
2. Update Medical Summary if anything changed
3. Check medication list is current
4. Update digital Medical ID if needed
5. Backup medical files

Prevents backlog and keeps information current.

## Real-World Usage
