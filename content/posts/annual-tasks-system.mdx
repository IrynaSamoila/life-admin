Annual tasks are easy to forget. Twelve months is long enough to completely lose track.

You don't need an app. You need a calendar and 30 minutes of setup.

## The Core Problem

Annual tasks fail for one reason: You rely on remembering.

Memory doesn't work on 12-month cycles. You need external systems.

## The Calendar-Based System

Every annual task becomes three calendar events.

### Event 1: Warning (30 Days Before)

**Title:** "PREPARE: [Task name]"

**Purpose:** Research, compare, gather information

**Examples:**
- "PREPARE: Car insurance renewal"
- "PREPARE: Boiler service"
- "PREPARE: ISA contribution deadline"

This gives you time to shop around, book appointments, or gather documents without urgency.

### Event 2: Action (7 Days Before)

**Title:** "DO: [Task name]"

**Purpose:** Actually complete the task

**Examples:**
- "DO: Renew car insurance"
- "DO: Book boiler service"
- "DO: Make ISA contribution"

One week is enough urgency to act but not so late you're forced into bad decisions.

### Event 3: Deadline (Actual Due Date)

**Title:** "DEADLINE: [Task name]"

**Purpose:** Final reminder, verification check

**Examples:**
- "DEADLINE: Car insurance expires"
- "DEADLINE: MOT required"
- "DEADLINE: Tax return due"

If you see this reminder, something went wrong with the first two.

## Setting It Up (30 Minutes)

You only do this once. Then it runs forever.

### Step 1: List Your Annual Tasks (10 minutes)

Go through the list above. Add tasks relevant to you. Remove tasks that don't apply.

**Your personal list might include:**
- Season ticket renewals
- Pet insurance
- Professional registration
- Specific maintenance for your property
- Membership renewals

Write them all down.

### Step 2: Find Your Due Dates (10 minutes)

For each task, determine the actual due date:

**Check these sources:**
- Previous year's calendar
- Email for renewal notices
- Physical documents (insurance certificates, etc.)
- Vehicle registration document
- Service records

If you can't find the exact date, estimate. You'll correct it when the first reminder comes.

### Step 3: Create Calendar Events (10 minutes)

For each task, create three events:

1. 30 days before: "PREPARE: [task]"
2. 7 days before: "DO: [task]"
3. Due date: "DEADLINE: [task]"

**Set recurrence:** Yearly from the same date

**Add details to event:**
- What needs doing
- Where to do it (website, phone number, location)
- Last year's cost (for budgeting)
- Notes from previous year

Done. You'll never forget again.

## Using the System

Setup is one-time. Usage is ongoing but minimal.

### When You See "PREPARE" Reminder (5-15 minutes)

You have 30 days. No urgency, just awareness.

**Actions:**
- Check if task is still needed
- Research options (for insurance, subscriptions)
- Compare prices
- Get quotes
- Note best option in calendar event

Don't commit yet. Just research.

### When You See "DO" Reminder (10-30 minutes)

Seven days to deadline. Time to act.

**Actions:**
- Complete the task
- Make the payment
- Book the appointment
- Submit the form
- Switch the provider

Actually do the thing.

Mark the calendar event as complete when done.

### When You See "DEADLINE" Reminder

If you see this, you ignored the previous two reminders.

**Emergency actions:**
- Do the task immediately
- Accept you won't get the best deal (no time to shop around)
- Set reminder to do better next year

This should rarely happen if you're following the system.

## Refinements Over Time

First year: You're learning what tasks you actually have and when they're due.

**After each task completion:**
- Update event with actual date (if estimate was wrong)
- Add notes about process
- Record this year's cost
- Note anything to do differently next year

Second year: Dates are accurate. Process is smooth. Notes help you remember what worked.

Third year: System is invisible. Tasks happen automatically.

## Common Variations

### Tasks with Flexible Timing

Some tasks don't have hard deadlines.

**Examples:**
- Garden maintenance
- Deep cleaning
- General servicing

**Calendar approach:**
- Set "DO" event for optimal month
- Skip "PREPARE" reminder
- No deadline (it's flexible)

### Tasks Triggered by External Events

Some tasks you can't predict in advance.

**Examples:**
- Appliance servicing (when it breaks)
- Medical appointments (when NHS contacts you)
- Ad-hoc repairs

**Calendar approach:**
- Don't add to calendar initially
- When triggered, add to calendar for next occurrence
- Build the recurring pattern over time

### Tasks Your Partner Handles

In shared households, split responsibilities.

**Calendar approach:**
- Share calendar
- Colour code by person responsible
- Each person gets their own reminders
- Both can see all tasks

Don't duplicate reminders. One person owns each task.

## The Physical Backup

Digital calendars fail. Phones break. Apps change.

**Have a physical backup:**
- Print annual task list
- Keep in household folder
- Update once yearly

If calendar disappears, you can rebuild from the list.

## What Doesn't Go in This System

This system handles recurring annual tasks. It doesn't handle:

**Not included:**
- One-off projects
- Daily/weekly tasks
- Irregular tasks with no pattern
- Tasks that require active tracking (like rotating mattress every 6 months)

Use different systems for different task types.

## Handling Life Changes

Life changes. Your annual tasks change too.

**When you:**
- Buy a house: Add home maintenance tasks
- Sell a car: Remove vehicle tasks
- Start business: Add business renewal tasks
- Have children: Add child-related annual tasks

**Update process:**
1. Identify new annual task
2. Add three calendar events
3. Set recurrence
4. Done

System adapts to your life.

## Results After One Year

After running this system for one year:

**What you'll notice:**
- Zero missed deadlines
- No last-minute insurance renewals
- No expired MOT panic
- Better deals (time to shop around)
- Lower stress

**Time saved:**
- No mental energy remembering tasks
- No emergency appointments at premium prices
- No late fees or penalties

**Time invested:**
- Setup: 30 minutes (one-time)
- Yearly maintenance: 10 minutes (updating dates)
- Per task: 5-30 minutes (same as before, but scheduled)

The system doesn't save time on the tasks themselves. It saves time and stress on remembering them.

## The Minimal Approach

Some people add every possible annual task to their calendar. Don't.

**Only add tasks that:**
- Are truly annual (not more frequent)
- Have actual consequences if missed
- You're responsible for completing

If a task happens naturally without reminders, it doesn't need to be in the system.

Keep the list minimal. Easier to maintain.

## One Year Later

After twelve months of this system, you'll have:

- Accurate dates for all tasks
- Notes on best providers
- Cost history for budgeting
- Proven process for each task
- Zero stress about forgetting

Year two is when the system pays off. You know exactly when everything happens and what to do.

The goal isn't perfection. It's a reliable system that works year after year.

Set it up once. Let it run forever.

Boring. Reliable. Effective.
