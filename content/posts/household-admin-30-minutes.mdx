Household admin doesn't need weekly attention. A consistent 30-minute monthly routine handles everything.

This system focuses on practical monthly tasks that prevent missed payments, lost documents, and financial surprises.

## Why Monthly Works

Weekly admin sessions are overkill. Most household admin operates on monthly cycles:
- Bills arrive monthly
- Bank statements close monthly
- Subscriptions charge monthly
- Mail accumulates over weeks, not days

Monthly review matches the natural rhythm of household admin.

## The 30-Minute Monthly Routine

Same time, same day, every month. First Sunday at 10am works well. Pick whatever suits your schedule.

### Minutes 0-5: Gather Everything (5 minutes)

Collect from designated locations:
- Mail inbox (physical pile of unopened mail)
- Bills folder
- Email inbox (filter by "bill" or "invoice")
- Downloaded statements from online accounts

Put it all in one physical pile or one folder. You'll process it in one go.

### Minutes 5-15: Process Paper and Email (10 minutes)

Go through the pile. Every item gets one of four actions:

**1. Pay immediately (bills due this month)**
- Mark as paid
- Schedule payment
- Move to "processed" pile

**2. Scan and file (documents to keep)**
- Scan using phone or scanner
- Name following convention: YYYY-MM-DD_Type_Description
- File digitally
- Shred physical

**3. Take action (requires response)**
- Reply immediately if under 2 minutes
- Add to action list if longer
- Set calendar reminder

**4. Destroy (junk mail, irrelevant)**
- Shred if contains personal info
- Bin if not

Don't create "to be filed" piles. Process completely or not at all.

### Minutes 15-20: Reconcile Finances (5 minutes)

Quick financial health check:

**Check these three things:**
1. Bank balance matches expectations
2. All expected payments went through
3. No unexpected charges appeared

If something looks wrong, note it for investigation. Don't deep-dive now.

**Calculate this month's position:**
- What came in
- What went out
- Difference from expected

Takes 5 minutes. Catches problems before they're serious.

### Minutes 20-25: Review Upcoming (5 minutes)

Look ahead to next month:

**Check calendar for:**
- Bills due next month
- Annual charges approaching
- Subscriptions renewing
- Admin tasks that need doing

**Set reminders for:**
- Anything requiring action
- Payments to schedule
- Deadlines to meet

This prevents last-minute panic.

### Minutes 25-30: Update Systems (5 minutes)

Maintenance keeps the system working:

**Update your tracking systems:**
- Subscription spreadsheet (any new charges?)
- Bill payment schedule (any changed dates?)
- Document retention folders (delete anything expired?)

**Tidy up:**
- Clear processed pile
- Empty shredding bin
- Reset inbox to zero

Leave your workspace as you found it. Ready for next month.

## The Support Infrastructure

The 30-minute routine only works if you have these in place:

### A Physical Inbox

One designated place for all incoming mail and documents.

**Not:**
- Kitchen counter
- "Various places"
- Wherever you happen to open mail

**Use:**
- Letter tray
- Box
- Drawer

One location. Everything goes there. You process it once monthly.

### Digital Filing System

Basic structure for scanned documents:

<FileTree>
Documents/
├── Finance/
├── Household/
├── Medical/
├── Legal/
└── Personal/
</FileTree>

That's sufficient. Don't overcomplicate.

### Bill Payment Calendar

Shared calendar showing when bills are due.

**For each recurring bill:**
- Event on due date
- Alert 3 days before
- Colour code by category (optional)

Prevents missed payments.

### Subscription Tracker

Simple spreadsheet tracking what you pay for.

Columns: Name | Cost | Frequency | Next Bill | Cancel URL

Update during the monthly routine when you see charges.

## Handling Items Between Sessions

Life doesn't pause between monthly sessions. Some things need immediate attention.

### The Exception Rules

**Process immediately (don't wait for monthly session):**
- Bills due before next session
- Legal documents requiring signature
- Time-sensitive correspondence
- Anything that will worry you if left

**Can wait for monthly session:**
- Bank statements
- Insurance renewal notices (unless due soon)
- General correspondence
- Non-urgent documents

Most things can wait. Urgency bias makes everything feel urgent.

### The 2-Minute Rule

If you open something and can deal with it in under 2 minutes, do it immediately.

Examples:
- Reply to simple email
- Pay a bill that's due
- Schedule an appointment

Don't create work for your monthly session that takes longer than just doing it now.

## Monthly Variations

Some months require more than 30 minutes. Plan for it.

### January (45 minutes)

**Extra tasks:**
- Gather tax documents
- Update annual trackers
- Review prior year spending
- Plan upcoming annual expenses

### April (45 minutes)

If UK tax year end applies:

**Extra tasks:**
- Final tax document gathering
- ISA contribution check (verify current limit, resets 6 April)
- Pension contribution check (verify current allowance)
- Charitable giving summary
- Tax return prep (if self-employed)
- Note: Check current ISA rules for flexibility options

### December (45 minutes)

**Extra tasks:**
- End of year financial review
- Update important documents
- Plan January tax tasks
- Archive previous year

All other months: 30 minutes.

## What Doesn't Belong in This Routine

This routine handles administrative paperwork. It doesn't handle:

**Not included:**
- Deep financial planning
- Investment decisions
- Major life admin projects
- Tax return completion
- Insurance comparison shopping

Those are separate tasks. Don't try to squeeze them into the monthly routine.

Schedule separately when needed.

## Common Problems and Fixes

### "The pile is too big to process in 10 minutes"

You're getting too much mail or not processing urgently enough.

**Fix:**
- Unsubscribe from marketing mail
- Switch to paperless billing
- Process urgent items immediately
- Start using the exception rules

### "I forget to do the monthly session"

Calendar reminder isn't working.

**Fix:**
- Tie it to existing habit (first Sunday breakfast)
- Set multiple reminders (day before, hour before)
- Tell someone you'll do it (accountability)
- Make it pleasant (good coffee, favorite music)

### "30 minutes isn't enough"

Either you have exceptional circumstances or you're overcomplicating.

**Check if you're:**
- Reading everything in detail (skim, don't deep read)
- Making decisions during processing (just sort, decide later)
- Organising beyond basic filing (simple is sufficient)
- Doing non-admin tasks (investment research, planning, etc.)

Stick to the routine's scope.

### "I need to do this weekly"

Probably not. Test monthly for three months before changing.

**Exceptions requiring weekly:**
- Running a business from home
- Managing rental properties
- Complex financial situation with frequent transactions

Standard household admin: Monthly is sufficient.

## Setting It Up First Time

If you're starting from chaos, do a one-time setup.

### Initial Setup (2-3 hours, one weekend)

**Saturday morning:**
1. Gather all documents from everywhere (30 min)
2. Sort into categories (60 min)
3. Destroy obvious junk (30 min)

**Saturday afternoon:**
4. Scan important documents (60 min)
5. Set up filing structure (20 min)
6. Create tracking systems (40 min)

**Sunday:**
7. Set up physical inbox (10 min)
8. Create calendar reminders (10 min)
9. Schedule first monthly session (5 min)
10. Process current pile using 30-minute routine (30 min)

After initial setup, maintenance is just 30 minutes monthly.

## Measuring Success

You'll know the system works when:

**After 1 month:**
- You know where everything is
- Nothing urgent gets missed
- Physical mail has a designated home

**After 3 months:**
- Monthly session feels routine
- Financial surprises are rare
- Document filing is automatic

**After 6 months:**
- Admin doesn't cause stress
- Bills are paid on time consistently
- You spend less time thinking about household admin

**After 12 months:**
- The system is invisible
- You can't imagine not doing it
- Others ask how you stay organised

## The Minimal Mindset

This system works because it's minimal:

**Minimal time:** 30 minutes monthly, not hours weekly

**Minimal systems:** One inbox, one filing system, one spreadsheet

**Minimal decisions:** Clear rules for what goes where

**Minimal maintenance:** The routine maintains itself

Don't add complexity. Resist the urge to optimise. The system works because it's simple enough to sustain.

## Year One vs. Year Two

First year: You're learning the rhythm. Sessions might run over. You'll forget occasionally. That's normal.

Second year: It's automatic. You know what to expect each month. Sessions take exactly 30 minutes. You might even find it satisfying.

The goal isn't perfection in month one. It's consistency over twelve months.

Consistency beats optimization.

## The Actual Practice

Theory looks different from practice. Here's what a real session looks like:

**10:00 - Start timer, grab coffee**

**10:01 - Gather pile from inbox (20 items)**

**10:05 - Process pile:**
- Bill 1: Pay now (2 min)
- Junk mail: Shred (10 sec)
- Bank statement: Scan, file, shred (1 min)
- Bill 2: Not due yet, back in inbox for next week (10 sec)
- Marketing: Recycle (5 sec)
- [Continue through pile]

**10:15 - Check bank account:**
- Balance: £2,341 (expected ~£2,400)
- Check last few transactions
- All expected payments cleared
- One unexpected Amazon charge: Add to investigation list

**10:20 - Review calendar:**
- Car insurance due next month
- Set reminder to compare quotes
- Gym membership renewing
- Set reminder to cancel (not using it)

**10:25 - Update systems:**
- Add new subscription to tracker
- Delete old expired documents
- Clear processed pile

**10:30 - Done**

Thirty minutes. One month of household admin handled.

Repeat next month.

That's the system.
