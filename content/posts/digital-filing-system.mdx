A good digital filing system should be invisible. You shouldn't think about it, debate where files go, or waste time searching. Here's how to build one that works.

## The Problem with Most Filing Systems

Most digital filing systems fail for predictable reasons:

- **Too many nested folders**: Paralysis when deciding where something goes
- **Inconsistent naming**: Some files use dates, some don't, no standard format
- **No clear rules**: Every save becomes a decision
- **Category overlap**: Does "Tax 2024" go in Finance or Legal?

The solution isn't more organisation. It's simpler organisation with stricter rules.

## The Two-Level Maximum Rule

Your filing system should have at most two levels of folders. That's it.

```
Documents/
├── Finance/
│   ├── file1.pdf
│   ├── file2.pdf
├── Legal/
│   ├── file1.pdf
├── Medical/
│   ├── file1.pdf
```

No Finance/Taxes/2024/Federal. Just Finance. Use filenames, not folder structures, to organise.

## The Five Core Categories

Most people need exactly five top-level folders:

### 1. Finance
Bank statements, tax documents, investment records, bills, receipts

### 2. Legal
Contracts, leases, titles, deeds, important agreements

### 3. Medical
Health records, insurance documents, prescriptions, test results

### 4. Personal
Identification documents, education records, certifications, resumes

### 5. Household
Warranties, manuals, home maintenance records, insurance policies

If something doesn't fit these categories, it probably doesn't need to be in your filing system. It belongs in project-specific folders or can be discarded.

## The Naming Convention

Every file follows the same format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD_Category_Description_Version.extension
```

Examples:
- `2024-04-15_Finance_TaxReturn_Final.pdf`
- `2024-12-01_Legal_LeaseAgreement_Signed.pdf`
- `2024-06-20_Medical_LabResults_Thyroid.pdf`

### Why this format works:

- **Date first**: Files sort chronologically automatically
- **Category**: Enables instant search without opening folders
- **Description**: Human-readable identification
- **Version**: Tracks iterations when necessary

## The Search-First Approach

With consistent naming, you don't navigate folders. You search.

Need your 2024 tax return? Search "2024 tax". Need your lease? Search "lease".

Your OS search function becomes your primary interface. Folders are just backup organisation.

## The Scan and Name Process

When you receive a document (paper or digital):

1. **Scan immediately** (if physical) using your phone or scanner
2. **Name following convention** - takes 10 seconds
3. **Save to appropriate top-level folder**
4. **Destroy or file physical document** based on retention rules

The entire process takes less than 60 seconds per document.

## Physical Document Retention Rules

Not everything needs to be kept physically. Here's what to keep:

**Keep original physical:**
- Birth certificates, marriage licenses, death certificates
- Property deeds, vehicle titles
- Original signed contracts
- Passport and Social Security card (in safe)

**Keep digital only:**
- Bank statements (after 1 month)
- Utility bills (after payment verification)
- Receipts (after warranty period)
- Medical records (after treatment completion)

**Destroy after digital scan:**
- Credit card statements
- Pay stubs
- Monthly bills
- Routine correspondence

## The Annual Archive Process

Once per year (I do this on January 1st), archive the previous year:

1. Create a folder: `Archive_YYYY`
2. Move all documents from previous year to archive
3. Compress archive folder to ZIP
4. Store ZIP in cloud backup
5. Delete local archive folder

This keeps your active filing system lean and fast.

## Cloud Backup Strategy

Your filing system needs three copies:

1. **Primary**: On your computer
2. **Backup**: Automated cloud backup (Backblaze, iDrive, etc.)
3. **Sync**: Encrypted cloud storage for access anywhere (next cloud with encryption)

Never rely on only one copy of important documents.

## The Mobile Workflow

Most documents enter your life while you're away from your computer. Set up a mobile capture system:

1. **Use your phone's document scanner** (iOS Notes, Google Drive, etc.)
2. **Scan immediately** when you receive paper
3. **Save to a "To File" folder** in your cloud storage
4. **Process once weekly** at your computer with proper naming

Don't let unfiled documents accumulate. Weekly processing prevents backlog.

## Setting Up Your System

Ready to implement? Here's your weekend project:

### Saturday Morning (2-3 hours):
- [ ] Create five top-level folders
- [ ] Install backup software
- [ ] Set up cloud storage with encryption
- [ ] Configure mobile document scanner

### Saturday Afternoon (3-4 hours):
- [ ] Gather all important documents
- [ ] Scan physical documents
- [ ] Rename existing digital files following convention
- [ ] Sort into appropriate folders
- [ ] Set up weekly "file documents" calendar reminder

### Sunday (1-2 hours):
- [ ] Create document retention checklist
- [ ] Destroy documents per retention rules
- [ ] File physical documents you're keeping
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Document your system (meta, I know)

## Maintenance: The Weekly 10-Minute Review

Every Sunday evening:

1. Process "To File" folder from mobile captures
2. Rename and file any new documents
3. Update any documents that need versioning
4. Verify cloud backup is current

That's it. Ten minutes weekly keeps the system running.

## What Success Looks Like

After three months with this system:

- Finding any document takes less than 10 seconds
- No decisions about where files go
- Zero time spent creating folder structures
- Complete confidence in backup system
- Average time to file a new document: 45 seconds

The system is boring, predictable, and invisible. Which means it works.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**"I have documents that fit multiple categories"**: Pick one. It doesn't matter which. You'll find it via search regardless.

**"What about documents I'm actively working on?"**: Those aren't archived documents. Keep them in project folders. Move to filing system when complete.

**"This seems too simple"**: Good. Simple systems get used. Complex systems get abandoned.

## Next Steps

Start with just the five folders and the naming convention. Don't migrate your entire digital life on day one.

File new documents properly starting today. Migrate old documents as you need them or have spare time.

The goal is a system you'll use for the next decade, not perfection by next week.
