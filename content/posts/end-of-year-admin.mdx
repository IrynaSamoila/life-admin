> **Note:** This guide covers UK-based admin tasks. Tax allowances and legal requirements change over time - always verify current rules at gov.uk or consult a financial adviser.

End of year isn't just holidays. It's prime time for administrative cleanup.

Some tasks have actual December 31st deadlines. Others just make sense to do while reviewing the year.

This checklist focuses on practical admin tasks that prevent missed deadlines, fees, and unnecessary stress throughout the year.

**You don't need to do everything on this list.** Use it as a reference and focus on the sections that apply to your situation.

Here's what actually matters.

## Why Year-End Admin Matters

**Time-sensitive reasons:**
- Tax year end approaching (April 5th for UK)
- Financial deadlines (ISA contributions, pension limits)
- Insurance renewals often in January
- Budget planning for new year

**Practical reasons:**
- Clear mental space for new year
- Review what worked/didn't work
- Update systems before they break
- Prevent January chaos

**Time required:** 3-4 hours total, spread over December

## Financial Tasks (December Priority)

These have real deadlines or save money.

### Review Pension Contributions

**Check if you've used annual allowance:**
- Verify current annual allowance (check gov.uk for latest figures)
- May be tapered for high earners
- In some cases, unused pension allowance from the previous three tax years can be carried forward, subject to eligibility and income rules

**If below limit and can afford:**
- Make additional contribution before April tax year end
- Tax relief on contributions
- Reduces taxable income

**How to check:**
- Request annual statement from pension provider
- Check payslips for monthly contributions
- Calculate: monthly × 12 + any bonuses

**Time:** 20 minutes

### Use ISA Allowance

**Annual ISA allowance:** Verify current limit at gov.uk

**Resets:** April 6th

**ISA flexibility:**
- ISA rules can change. Check current guidance on how many ISAs you can open and contribute to in one tax year
- Partial transfers between providers may be allowed
- Verify current regulations

**Action before April:**
- Check current year contributions across all ISAs
- Use remaining allowance if possible
- Consider spreading between providers for better rates
- Decide if ISA makes sense for your situation

**How to check:**
- Log in to all ISA providers
- View current year deposits across all accounts
- Calculate remaining allowance against current limit

**Time:** 20 minutes

### Review Subscriptions and Memberships

**Year-end is good time because:**
- You can see full year of usage
- Many renew in January
- Fresh budget for new year

**Process:**
1. Open subscription tracker (you have one, right?)
2. For each subscription:
   - Did I use this in last 3 months?
   - Will I use it next year?
   - Can I get it cheaper?
3. Cancel unused before January renewals

**Time:** 30 minutes

**Typical savings:** £200-500/year

### Review Bank Accounts and Credit Cards

**Check for:**
- Accounts you don't use (close them)
- Better rates available elsewhere
- Unused overdrafts (reduce to £0)
- Cashback/rewards not being used

**Annual fee credit cards:**
- Is annual fee worth the rewards?
- If not, cancel before renewal (usually January)

**Time:** 20 minutes

### Claim Tax-Deductible Expenses

**If self-employed or claiming work expenses:**

**Gather receipts for:**
- Business expenses
- Work-from-home costs
- Professional subscriptions
- Required equipment

**Don't wait until January:** Gather now while year is fresh.

**Time:** 30-60 minutes depending on complexity

### Charitable Giving Summary

**If you donate regularly:**
- Total up annual charitable giving

- Get tax relief if applicable

**Time:** 15 minutes

### Review Investment Tax Position

**Check dividend income:**
- Verify current dividend allowance and tax rates
- Rates can change each tax year

**Check savings interest:**
- Verify current Personal Savings Allowance for your tax band
- Rates vary by income level

**At a high level, consider tax-efficient positioning:**
- Use ISA allowances for tax-free growth
- Review savings account splits between partners
- Review timing of dividend-paying investments

**Time:** 15 minutes
