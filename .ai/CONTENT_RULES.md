# Content Editing Rules (UK Admin Site)

This site provides UK-based, evergreen, non-advisory admin content.

## Scope
- Content is UK-focused unless explicitly stated.
- Rules, allowances, and requirements can change over time.
- Articles must remain valid even if specifics change.

## Safety Principles
- Describe processes, not instructions.
- Avoid legal, financial, or medical advice.
- Use "typically", "often", "in many cases" instead of absolutes.
- Prefer ranges or qualitative wording over fixed numbers.
- Avoid promises of savings or outcomes.

## Finance & Tax
- Do not hardcode tax allowances, rates, or thresholds.
- Use phrasing like "verify current limits" or "check current guidance".
- Pension and ISA rules must be qualified (eligibility varies).

## Legal & Compliance
- Avoid listing specific fines or penalties.
- Say "penalties may include..." instead of amounts.
- Avoid guarantees about legality or enforcement.

## Vehicles
- All service intervals vary by manufacturer and driving conditions.
- Tyre replacement above legal minimum is a safety choice, not a rule.
- Warning light meanings vary by vehicle; advise checking the manual.
- DIY maintenance must include a safety/warranty disclaimer.

## Medical
- Admin-only (scheduling, records).
- No diagnosis, treatment, or optimisation language.
- Reference national guidance where relevant.

## Tone
- Calm, practical, boring.
- No fear-mongering.
- No motivational or sales language.

## Editing Instructions for AI
When fixing articles:
- Make minimal changes.
- Preserve structure and tone.
- Do not add new sections unless required for safety.
- Prioritise clarity and future-proofing over precision.

## Admin Processes
- Avoid stating specific deadlines unless legally fixed.
- Use “as soon as possible” instead of exact timeframes.
- Avoid “always” or “automatically” without qualifiers like “usually”.
